            <h3>Rationale</h3>
            <p>Since May, Massachusetts has used a definition for COVID-19 risk level based on
                the daily incidence by population over the previous two weeks. It was a reasonable
                system, if not used effectively.</p>
            <p>Governor Charlie Baker made clear that his primary goal is to keep the economy
                going and schools open. Not suppressing spread of the virus.</p>
            <p>So what does he do when cases start to explode? Change the risk levels.</p>
            <p>Under the new system, every community that was previously medium risk and just
                barely high risk was now "low risk".</p>
            <p>Under the new system, every community that was previously solidly high risk was
                deemed "medium risk" so long as their testing positivity was low enough.</p>
            <p>And for some reason, the thresholds were adjusted slightly for three population
                categories. Even though incidence is already expressed on a per-population basis.
                And something about not wanting to "penalize" cities for testing more?</p>
            <p>(I watched the press conference revealing the new system, Gov. Baker couldn't
                clearly articulate the rationale for any of this.)</p>
            <p>That said, he gave away the real rationale: <a href="https://boston.cbslocal.com/2020/11/06/governor-charlie-baker-update-friday-coronavirus-massachusetts-schools-transmission-rates/">Moving the goal posts to keep schools open.</a></p>
            <p>As a result, I started generating maps using the old system, with some tweaks to
                reveal communities with 0 cases, and added additional shades of red to show off
                increases within the high risk category. Code (in <a href="https://www.julialang.org">Julia</a>)
                is available on <a href="https://www.github.com/BioTurboNick/MassCovid.jl">GitHub</a>.</p>
            <p>The maps are updated after the <a href="https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-response-reporting#covid-19-weekly-public-health-report-">Massachusetts Weekly Public Health Report</a> is released each week.</p>
            <p>I also maintain a graph of the incidence rate in Boston neighborhoods and an overview of COVID behavior across the US.</p>

            <p>Data from the <a href="https://bphc.org/">Boston Public Health Commission</a> weekly
                report, which is usually released on Fridays. Massachusetts reopening stages are marked.
                Second axis goes along with the "Overall" dashed line. Some cases aren't assigned to a
                neighborhood, which is why the Boston line sometimes departs from the stack.</p>
            <p>Isn't it odd how we were doing great until we started reopening?</p>

            <p>Since May 20, I've been manually tracking whether each state (+ PR/DC) has been seeing
                COVID-19 cases increase, plateau, decrease slightly, or decrease strongly.</p>
            <p>November 22, 2020 - the first time that every single state/territory is in the "up"
                category simultaneously.</p>
